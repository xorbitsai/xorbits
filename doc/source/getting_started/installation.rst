Installation
============

Xorbits can be installed via pip from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/xorbits>`__.

::

    pip install xorbits


.. _install.version:

Python version support
----------------------

Officially Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

Packages support
----------------

Xorbits partitions large datasets into chunks and processes each individual 
chunk using single-node packages (such as pandas). Currently, our latest version strives 
to be compatible with the latest single-node packages. The table below lists the highest 
versions of the single-node packages that Xorbits are compatible with. If you are using 
an older version of pandas, you should either upgrade your pandas or downgrade Xorbits.

.. note::

   You are highly encouraged to install these libraries, as they provide speed improvements,
   especially when working with large datasets.

Recommended dependencies can be installed using ``pip``.

::

    pip install 'xorbits[extra]'


The following extra dependencies will be installed.

.. _install.optional_dependencies:

* `numexpr <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr>`__: for accelerating certain numerical operations.
  ``numexpr`` uses multiple cores as well as smart chunking and caching to achieve large speedups.

* `pillow <https://python-pillow.org/>`__: the Python Imaging Library.

* `pyarrow <https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/>`__: python API for Arrow C++ libraries.
