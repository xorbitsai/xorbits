The User Guide covers all of Xorbits by topic area. Each of the subsections
introduces a topic (such as "deployment"), and discusses how
Xorbits approaches the problem, with many examples throughout.

Users brand-new to Xorbits should start with :ref:`10min_numpy` and :ref:`10min_pandas`.

Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the
:ref:`reference_index`.
