"Most Xorbits objects, including Xorbits :class:`DataFrame`, are "
"implemented to use deferred execution. Deferred execution means that "
"operations on Xorbits objects are not executed immediately as they are "
"called. Instead, Xorbits builds an execution plan and the plan will not "
"be executed until the result is actually required."

"Deferred execution can greatly improve performance when you manipulate "
"large datasets. Optimizations can be applied to the chained operations "
"before calling the backend. For example, identical parts of an execution "
"plan can be eliminated and executed only once."

"To trigger the execution manually, you can use :func:`run`. You pass an "
"Xorbits object or a list of Xorbits objects as the argument."
