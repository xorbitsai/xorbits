"For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple "

"Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is "
"known. Hence, several functions are offered to create arrays with initial"

"expensive operation."

msgid ""
"The function ``zeros`` creates an array full of zeros, the function "
"``ones`` creates an array full of ones, and the function ``empty`` "
"creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state"
" of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is "
"``float64``, but it can be specified via the key word argument ``dtype``."

"To create sequences of numbers, use ``arange`` function which is "
"analogous to the Python built-in ``range``, but returns an array."

msgid ""
"When ``arange`` is used with floating point arguments, it is generally "
"not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the "

" use the function ``linspace`` that receives as an argument the number of"
" elements that we want, instead of the step::"
