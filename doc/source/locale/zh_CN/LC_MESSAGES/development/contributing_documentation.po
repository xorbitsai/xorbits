"Contributing to the documentation benefits everyone who uses Xorbits. We "

" be an expert on Xorbits to do so! In fact, there are sections of the "
"docs that are worse off after being written by experts. If something in "
"the docs doesn't make sense to you, updating the relevant section after "
"you figure it out is a great way to ensure it will help the next person. "
